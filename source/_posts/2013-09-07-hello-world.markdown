As a developer I figured I better start off blogging with a "Hello World."

I'm planning to use this blog to talk about things I find interesting, mostly that's programming.
But I have some other interests as well!

I'm just starting to learn Ruby and the Rails framework and I hope to use this blog to talk about my
experiences with it. I love learning new languages, but I've been particularly enjoying learning
Ruby, it's a great language. I come primarily from a C and Java/C# background and I've dabbled with
Python, Perl, and PHP. However, I've found a strong affinity for Ruby and the Ruby Way.

I hope that as I continue to post, others will find this useful, or share their experiences or
insights in the comments.
