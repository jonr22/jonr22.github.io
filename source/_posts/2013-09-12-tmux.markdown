I've got tmux setup on my mac now. I'm running it in iterm2 and using zsh as the default shell. It
took a lot of playing with to get it setup right, but so far I think it's worth it! Obviously I'm
still learning a ton and I hope to share my experiences as I continue working with these tools, but
so far I've found some great resources.

A great article on setting up iterm2, vim, tmux and zsh:
[drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate](http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate)

Also the github repos I mentioned in my previous post from
[thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and
[square](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome) both have some great config settings, and
[thoughtbot](https://learn.thoughtbot.com/tmux) has some additional helpful articles as well.

The only issue that I had trouble with was getting colors to display properly in vim when in tmux.
My colors ([solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)) would display fine in the regular
terminal, but as soon as I started up tmux and tried to run vim inside of it, the colors would get
messed up. It turns out I needed to set the TERM from which I was calling tmux, this can be done in
one of two ways, the first would be to call tmux like this (or set an alias):

```bash
TERM=xterm-256color tmux
```

The other is to update your terminal app to set TERM appropriately, in iTerm2 I did this in
`Preferences > Profile > Terminal > Report Terminal Type` which I set to `xterm-256color`
