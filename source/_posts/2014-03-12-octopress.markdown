I've just started using the [octopress](http://octopress.org/) blogging framework (A blogging
framework for hackers) and so far I really like it. It's super easy to setup, assuming you're
a developer / hacker (and especially if you're familiar with ruby). If you're interested, the
documentation on their website is very easy to follow.

Previously I was using wordpress, and while it's a fine platform, I never wanted to pay for
it, so my ability to customize felt very limited. Now with octopress I have complete
flexibility and since it's open source I have access to the code. In fact I've already looked
around the code a bit to help me find the sass variables I needed to customize the look and feel
of the site.

Octopress has been setup so that it's very easy to customize, especially for small CSS changes.
They've nicely setup a `custom` directory with sass stylesheets that get loaded last, so that
you can override any CSS settings and SASS variables. Overall it seems very well thought out.

Combine this with the ability to host the site on github for free and you've got a great setup.
Not to mention, if you do much with github, then you're probably somewhat familiar with the
markdown language, so you already have the knowledge needed to create posts.

Another benefit that I like is being able to write my posts in my favorite editor, vim!!
