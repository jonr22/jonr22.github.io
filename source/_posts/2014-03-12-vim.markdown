Square recently released their Vim setup on github
[github.com/square/maximum-awesome/tree/master/vim/bundle](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome/tree/master/vim/bundle).
I've had a look through it and I've found some great stuff to add to my current vim setup
[github.com/jonr22/dotfiles](https://github.com/jonr22/dotfiles). They've got some
useful stuff in there and I definitely recommmend checking it out. It's really great to see
these things being shared with the community!

I've always loved using vim, but being new to Ruby and to Rails I didn't realize how many great
plugins there are out there (most of them seem to be by Tim Pope, he's got a lot of great Vim
stuff!!). This got me looking around and I found some good stuff from thoughtbot as well
[github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

Looking around at this stuff, I've noticed that a lot of people seem to be using iTerm2, tmux, and zsh. I'm going
to have to look at these soon, I've always used bash and I'm pretty comfortable with it, but
zsh might be worth a try. I've done most of my terminal work on linux, so terminal.app was always
good enough for me when I've been on my mac. These days I seem to be doing a lot more on mac instead of my
linux VMs though, so I'm looking forward to trying out iTerm2.
