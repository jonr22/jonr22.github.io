I'm a developer living in Boston, MA and working for a software company. In my free time I like to
learn new programming languages and write code for personal projects.

I love working with new technologies, I particularly like working on mac and linux. I'm currently
learning Ruby and the Rails platform.

When I'm not programming I like taking photographs, sailing and cycling. I used to race cars but
haven't had the time or resources to race for the past few years.
