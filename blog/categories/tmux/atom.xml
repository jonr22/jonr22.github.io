    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve got tmux setup on my mac now. I&rsquo;m running it in iterm2 and using zsh as the default shell. It
took a lot of playing with to get it setup right, but so far I think it&rsquo;s worth it! Obviously I&rsquo;m
still learning a ton and I hope to share my experiences as I continue working with these tools, but
so far I&rsquo;ve found some great resources.</p>

<p>A great article on setting up iterm2, vim, tmux and zsh:
<a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate">drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate</a></p>

<p>Also the github repos I mentioned in my previous post from
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles">thoughtbot</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome">square</a> both have some great config settings, and
<a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/tmux">thoughtbot</a> has some additional helpful articles as well.</p>

<p>The only issue that I had trouble with was getting colors to display properly in vim when in tmux.
My colors (<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a>) would display fine in the regular
terminal, but as soon as I started up tmux and tried to run vim inside of it, the colors would get
messed up. It turns out I needed to set the TERM from which I was calling tmux, this can be done in
one of two ways, the first would be to call tmux like this (or set an alias):</p>

<p><code>bash
TERM=xterm-256color tmux
</code></p>

<p>The other is to update your terminal app to set TERM appropriately, in iTerm2 I did this in
<code>Preferences &gt; Profile &gt; Terminal &gt; Report Terminal Type</code> which I set to <code>xterm-256color</code></p>
